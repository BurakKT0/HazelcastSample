# HazelcastSample

Hazelcast operates as an open-source in-memory data grid (IMDG) and is a distributed caching and in-memory data storage platform. The system has been meticulously designed to demonstrate exceptional fault tolerance and high availability, including the effective administration of failover situations. In the event of a failover situation, Hazelcast implements an assortment of tactics to guarantee the ongoing operation of the system and the accessibility of data. The following is a concise depiction of Hazelcast's conduct during a failover:

1. **Cluster Architecture**

Hazelcast functions as an interconnected cluster of nodes (or members), with each node responsible for storing a fraction of the complete dataset. Without requiring interruption, the cluster can be scaled dynamically by adding or removing nodes.

2. **Data Replication and Partitioning**
Hazelcast performs the operation of dividing the data into fragments, which are then distributed among the cluster members. In order to ensure redundancy, specific data elements are duplicated across numerous nodes. The determination of the partition count and number of replicas is dependent on the desired degree of defect tolerance.

3. **Membership Management**
Using a pulse mechanism, Hazelcast monitors the condition of each individual in the cluster. Hazelcast is capable of identifying node failures, which are indicated by unresponsiveness, and executing the requisite actions to safeguard the cluster's stability.

4. **Failover Handling**
   - **Data Rebalancing**
The partitions that were previously hosted by an unsuccessful node are automatically redistributed to other nodes that are available in the cluster. This process is referred to as data rebalancing. Maintaining optimal performance requires that a balanced distribution of data be achieved among the remaining nodes.
   
   - **Promotion of Backups**
If a node failure occurs and prevents access to the primary replica of data, Hazelcast will expeditiously elevate one of the backup replicas to the equivalent status of the new primary. Data availability is retained even in the case of node failures.
   
   - **Split-Brain Handling**
Hazelcast utilizes split-brain detection and resolution methods to mitigate data inconsistencies and provide optimal consistency in the event of network partitions, commonly referred to as split-brain, resulting in the formation of several sub-clusters.

5. **Client Failover**
Hazelcast clients are frequently provided with failover configurations. If a client loses connection to one member, it will immediately attempt to connect to another accessible member in the cluster..

6. **Quorum**
Hazelcast enables the customization of quorum rules to establish the minimal number of nodes needed for specific operations (such as write or read) to be deemed successful. This facilitates the preservation of data consistency and accessibility even in compromised conditions.

In conclusion, during a failover scenario, Hazelcast adjusts its cluster topology, redistributes data, promotes backups, and maintains client communication to ensure continuous data availability and system functionality. The main goal is to guarantee a high degree of availability and resilience in remote situations. By appropriately configuring Hazelcast with redundancy, segmentation, and quorum settings, the system may provide efficient handling of failures and speedy recovery.Ensures the system's ability to gracefully tolerate faults and swiftly recover.
